          <h1>Accessibility</h1>

          <p>This website is run by Trevor Saint. I want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
          </ul>
