          <h2>My process</h2>

          <div class="color-contrast-medium">
            <p>I started designing with low-fidelity prototypes which consisted of sticky notes and hand-drawn sketches which helped brainstorm.</p>
            <p>Balsamiq helped me quickly create rough concepts to test scenarios with judges.</p>
            <p>Later, I created hi-fidelity mockups using Sketch to get an overall look and feel for the interface and to design a collection of reusable components for the service.</p>

            <p>Later, I moved Sketch designs into prototype code. This took time to ramp up but once I did, it was very fast to prototype new features.</p>

            <p>Research visits around England included 12 locations, 25 participants and over 104 hours of research. We also worked with individual service lines to use their research saving us a lot of time and duplication of effort.</p>
            <p class="font-bold">From our research we defined:</p>
