              <p>User research was a big part of the project. We were able to gather valuable insight which improved both design and our approach.</p>
              <p>We observed farmers in the office and on their farms interacting with prototypes we designed and developed. We were able to watch and learn from them interacting with the service.</p>
              <p>Researchers helped us learn about our users and helped to make sure our design patterns, page flows worked well for our users. Research conducted also included people with disabilities and non-tech savvy people.</p>
              <p>It was a valuable insight watching non-tech savvy people interacting with the prototypes as well as how rural locations can have such a damaging effect on poor internet connections.</p>

              <p>Government Digital Services (GDS) had created a design system to ensure design consistency across all Government services. Their design system was a solid foundation to build upon including patterns like typography, colours, grid and form-based patterns.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, their system did not include patterns that were essential for our service and user needs, so I designed and built our own.</p>
